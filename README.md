# Titanic_research
Student research paper using machine learning to predict survivability on the Titanic based on various variables.  

## Abstract <br />
	This research paper aims to identify variables that can lead to survivability of the Titanic.  RStudio and machine learning algorithm was specifically used to create a decision tree to identify such variables.  The dataset was extracted from Kaggle.com to use to create the top-down decision tree.  It was concluded that variables such as gender and age was the determining factor for survivability on the Titanic.
