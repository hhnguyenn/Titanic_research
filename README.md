Student research paper using machine learning to predict survivability on the Titanic based on various variables.  

Abstract
	This research paper aims to identify variables that can lead to survivability of the Titanic.  RStudio and machine learning algorithm was specifically used to create a decision tree to identify such variables.  The dataset was extracted from Kaggle.com to use to create the top-down decision tree.  It was concluded that variables such as gender and age was the determining factor for survivability on the Titanic.
